## 🚧Project Overview

This project aims to delve into the intricacies of credit card fraud detection by exploring two critical aspects:

Merchant Category Analysis: In this segment, we will thoroughly examine the relationship between different merchant categories and instances of fraud. By dissecting transaction data across various merchant types, we seek to uncover patterns and insights that can help identify high-risk categories.

Transaction Type Analysis: We will conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine if certain transaction types are more vulnerable to fraudulent activities compared to others. By scrutinizing transaction attributes such as payment methods, transaction amounts, and more, we aim to shed light on potential risk factors.

By addressing these aspects, our project endeavors to contribute valuable knowledge to the field of credit card fraud detection, ultimately enhancing the security measures employed by financial institutions and cardholders.

## 📈About the Dataset

### 📝 Description

This dataset comprises credit card transactions conducted by European cardholders in the year 2023. It encompasses an extensive dataset of over 550,000 records, carefully anonymized to protect the privacy and identities of the cardholders. The primary purpose of curating this dataset is to provide a valuable resource for the development of fraud detection algorithms and models, enabling the identification of potentially deceptive transactions.

### Key Features

- **id**: A unique identifier assigned to each transaction.
- **V1-V28**: A set of anonymized features that encapsulate diverse transaction attributes such as time, location, and more.
- **Amount**: Denoting the transaction value.
- **Class**: A binary label, distinguishing transactions as either fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

## ❓Questions for Analysis

### 1. What is the distribution of transaction amounts in fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions?

Consider examining how transaction amounts differ between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

### 2. Are there specific time patterns when fraudulent transactions are more likely to occur?

Analyze the timestamp data to identify any time patterns associated with fraudulent transactions.

### 3. Do certain anonymized features (V1-V28) have a stronger correlation with fraud?

Explore the correlation between the anonymized features (V1-V28) and the occurrence of fraud.

### 4. Can you identify any geographical patterns in fraud occurrences based on transaction attributes?

Investigate whether location-related attributes (if available) exhibit patterns in fraud occurrences.

### 5. Are there any common trends or characteristics shared among fraudulent transactions in this dataset?
