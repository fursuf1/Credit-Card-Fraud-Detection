Data clean-up:

- Check for nulls
- Check for duplicates

EDA:

- Histograms of the whole dataset
- One set of histograms for the dataset with only valid transactions
- One set of histograms for the dataset with only fraudulent transactions
- Scatter-plots each feature VS Class
- Correlation heat map

Modeling:

- Logistic regression (also explain why it may not work due to multiple features having collinearity)
	- Try test sets at different sizes? (0.2, 0.1, 0.05)
	- Plot heat map of confusion matrix
	- Calculate accuracy, error rate, sensitivity and specificity, etc
- Scale the data using standard scaler
	- Try K-means clustering?
- RoC curve?
